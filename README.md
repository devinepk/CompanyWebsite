# About

This is a basic website I'm building to showcase my podcast production company.  The premise is using something existing and making it my own (to a certain extent), instead of starting something from scratch.  I have a separate website hosted with a popular website builder, and it is less than satisfactory for what I would like to do.  

## Specifics
This will have the following components (it is a fluid list):
- Single Page
- Hero image with text overlay (provided in template)
- Pricing table (provided in template)
- Testimonials (proided in template)
- Sample podcast episodes/shows
- Contact Us section

## Credits
I'm using a bootstrap template called [ThemeLight 2](https://themefisher.com/products/themelight-bootstrap-business-one-page-website-template/) from [ThemeFisher](https://www.themefisher.com).
